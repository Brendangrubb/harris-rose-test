          <p id="panel-three-right-text" class="text-four">By controlling the temperature, the fermentation does not begin. After this time the juice drains or is pressed away from the pips and skins and is moved to another deposit to begin fermenting.

          <p class="text-four">Cigales is a small farming community of 5,000 in western Spain. They’ve been making wine since before Ferdinand of Aragon disguised himself as a mule driver in an attempt to get close to Isabel the Catholic. Clarete is not red wine, but it’s not exactly rosé either. So, what is it?</p>

          <p class="text-four">The ecclesiastical icon of Cigales town is the Iglesia de Santiago Apostol, started in 1535 by Rodrigo Gil de Hontañon. Finished in 1772, its monumental white, limestone stones reveal the special position that Cigales held due to its proximity to the royal courts of Valladolid nearby. It regularly hosted counts from Benavente and kings and nobles from afar. It had residual star power. And they toasted with clarete.</p>
