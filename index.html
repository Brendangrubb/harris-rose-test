            <p>The streets are completely deserted and the only sound is the rustling of plastic, fluorescent bead ropes hanging from door frames of the bars along the perimeter of the town square. In the background there is a soft clanking of dishes being hustled through soapy water on their way to a drying rack. Under calcified, shingled rooftops, children engage in verbal sparring before their flan de huevo sugar high disintegrates into tears and tantrums. La siesta is not far behind. The bead strands part and out walk two men preparing to smoke, clarete in hand.</p>

            <p>Cigales is a small farming community of 5,000 in western Spain. They’ve been making wine since before Ferdinand of Aragon disguised himself as a mule driver in an attempt to get close to Isabel the Catholic (he did, they married in 1469, and together conquered the world). The local appellation takes its name from the town; its official tagline is ‘Cuna del Clarete’, or cradle of clarete. Ordering a clarete is as common as a flat white in London or an IPA in Portland. It is not red wine, but it’s not exactly rosé either. So, what is it?</p>

              <p>Typically, rosé, called rosado here, is made by cold macerating the skins together with the juice in a deposit for eight to 24 hours or until the right color tone from extraction of the skins is obtained. The winemaker makes the call. By controlling the temperature, the fermentation does not begin. After this time the juice drains or is pressed away from the pips (seeds) and skins and is moved to another deposit to begin fermenting. Almost always there is yeast added to inoculate, or jump-start, this process.</p>

              <p>Clarete is not like this. The fermentation is allowed to start with the juice and skins together at a higher temperature, usually uncontrolled. Because native yeasts travel on the skins, the must (pre-fermented wine) has the bump it needs to begin converting its sugars into alcohol. This is the same process as red winemaking. The juice is allowed to free run from the skins and clarete is born. Rosé is available to the market by Christmas or January, but clarete is not until April. Clarete is often less expensive because it doesn’t require temperature controlling and manufactured yeasts are not typically added unless the fermentation stalls. It is a more natural wine.</p>
